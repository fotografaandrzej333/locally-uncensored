## v2.4.6 — Current Release

**Hotfix: 1 fix on top of v2.4.5.**

Auto-update prompts on next launch. Reported by **nightmare13740** on Discord 2026-05-18 with a clean ollama-CLI A/B comparison.

### What's fixed
- **Chat throughput restored on tight-VRAM cards** (Bug L — nightmare13740 Discord). LU was sending `num_gpu: 99` on every Ollama chat request, forcing all model layers onto the GPU regardless of free VRAM. On 8 GB-VRAM laptop cards (e.g. RTX 4070 Laptop + gemma3:4b) the KV cache had nowhere to live except system RAM, dragging chat speed from **30 tok/s** in ollama CLI down to **6.9 tok/s** in LU. v2.4.6 drops the override entirely so Ollama applies its own VRAM-aware layer-placement logic — no-op on cards with headroom, full CLI parity on tight cards.

### Stability
- `vitest`: 93 files / **2284 tests** green (rewrote 3 assertions to lock in the absence of `num_gpu` in chat-request bodies).
- `cargo test --release`: **89 passed + 1 ignored** (unchanged; Rust edits were inside the JS remote-access template, not Rust unit-tested).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean. `cargo check`: clean (pre-existing dead-code warnings only).
- No breaking changes, no localStorage migration — upgrade in place.

### Heads-up
v2.4.6 is a Windows + Linux release; macOS is not part of this build. `#bug-reports` / `#help-*` / GitHub will be monitored daily for regression reports.

For previous release notes (v2.4.5 — 14 bugs), see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

For older releases, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Download

### Windows
Download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest):
- **`.exe`** — NSIS installer (recommended)
- **`.msi`** — Windows Installer

> **Other platforms:** The source code builds on Linux and macOS via `npm run tauri build`, but only Windows is officially tested and supported.

> **Plug & Play:** Just install and launch. The setup wizard auto-detects all 12 supported local backends ([Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), llama.cpp, LocalAI, Jan, GPT4All, text-generation-webui, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite, SGLang). Nothing installed yet? The wizard shows one-click install links for every backend.

> **Antivirus warning?** Some engines (ESET, Avast, Microsoft SmartScreen) flag the installer as suspicious — this is a **false positive** caused by heuristics on unsigned NSIS installers that download other binaries. The installer is built by GitHub Actions from public source on `master` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). The auto-update channel is signed against a public minisign key. Full context, verification steps, and one-click vendor submission links: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#antivirus--browser-false-positives).

## Quick Start

> **New to Locally Uncensored?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/guide/) with screenshots for every step.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup

> ⚠️ **Just want to use the app?** Grab the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest) (the `.exe` or `.msi` in the **Download** section above). That gives you the full Tauri desktop app with auto-update. The commands below start LU in **browser dev-mode** — fewer features, Vite proxy noise, meant for contributing to the codebase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat   # Windows — installs Node, Git, Ollama, then npm run dev
# setup.sh  # macOS / Linux equivalent
```

Launches at `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser.

### Image & Video Generation

Open the **Create** tab. ComfyUI is auto-detected or one-click installed. Models download with one click. Workflow is set to **Auto** — just write a prompt and hit Generate.
